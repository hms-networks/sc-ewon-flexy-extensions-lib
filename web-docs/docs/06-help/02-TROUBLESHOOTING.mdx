## Disclaimer

<>The information provided in this section is intended to assist with troubleshooting common issues
that may be encountered when using the {ScDocusaurusConfig.title}. This information is provided
as-is, and is not intended to be a comprehensive troubleshooting guide.</><br/><br/>

If you are unable to resolve an issue using the information provided in this section, please
visit the [Support](03-SUPPORT.mdx) page for additional support options.

## 1. IDE Auto-Import Errors

### Symptom

<>When using an IDE that supports auto-import functionality, such as IntelliJ IDEA, you may
encounter errors during the auto-import process for the {ScDocusaurusConfig.title}. These errors
may display as messages and/or project source files may be hidden in the IDE.</><br/>

### Cause

In most cases, these errors are likely caused by an issue with the project configuration files,
such as the `pom.xml` file.

### Solution

To resolve these errors, try the following:

1. Double-check that the project configuration files are valid and all required steps were completed
   during setup.
2. If the project configuration files are valid, try restarting the IDE and re-importing the
   project.
    1. Some IDEs may include an option to "Invalidate Caches and Restart" when restarting.
       If this option is available, try using it before re-importing the project. Note: This option
       may be found in the "File" menu.
3. If the errors persist, try reverting to a previously known good commit, or resetting local
   changes.

## 2. Build Warnings or Errors in ExampleMain or ExampleTest

### Symptom

<>When building the {ScDocusaurusConfig.title}, you may encounter build warnings or errors in the
`ExampleMain.java` or `ExampleTest.java` files. These errors may prevent the build from
completing successfully.</><br/>

### Cause

<>The `ExampleMain.java` and `ExampleTest.java` files are included in the {ScDocusaurusConfig.title}
&nbsp;as an example. These files are not required for the {ScDocusaurusConfig.title} to function
properly, and may be removed if desired.</><br/>

### Solution

If you do not wish to use the `ExampleMain.java` and `ExampleTest.java` files, you may remove them
from the project.

If you wish to use the `ExampleMain.java` and `ExampleTest.java` files, you may need to update the
files to resolve the identified build warnings or errors. The following recommendations may be
helpful when updating the files:

- The `ExampleMain.java` file contains a `getExampleValue()` method that returns an `int` value.
  This method may be updated to return a different value, or removed if desired.
- The `ExampleTest.java` file contains a handful of methods which perform basic mathematics
  operations on the return value from `getExampleValue()` in `ExampleMain.java`.
  These methods may be updated to perform different operations, or removed if desired.
    - Optionally, the `ExampleTest.java` file may be deleted if desired. Note: if the
      `ExampleTest.java` file is deleted, it is recommended to also remove the `getExampleValue()`
      method from `ExampleMain.java`.

## 3. Javadoc Errors During Build After Updating the POM File

### Symptom

<>When building the {ScDocusaurusConfig.title}, you may encounter build errors related to the
generation of Javadocs. These errors may prevent the build from completing successfully.</><br/>

### Cause

A recently added or updated dependency in the `pom.xml` file may include invalid Javadocs, or the
Javadocs may not be available.

### Solution

Dependencies that introduce Javadoc errors may be excluded from the Javadoc generation process by
modifying the `pom.xml` file.

To exclude a dependency from the Javadoc generation process, add a
corresponding `<dependencySourceExclude></dependencySourceExclude>` to
the `org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-javadoc-plugin` `<plugin></plugin>` section of your `pom.xml`.

:::info

For example, to exclude the Javadoc documentation for the `commons-lang:commons-lang` dependency,
add the following to
the `org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-javadoc-plugin` `<plugin></plugin>` section of your `pom.xml`:

```xml

<dependencySourceExclude>commons-lang:commons-lang:*</dependencySourceExclude>
```
