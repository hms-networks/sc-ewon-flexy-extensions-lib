### POM File Fields

#### name

The `name` field modifies the project's name. This field is used by the Maven build system to
name the project's JAR file, and is used by the application to display the project's name.

#### version

The `version` field modifies the project's version. This field is used by the Maven build system
to name the project's JAR file, and is used by the application to display the project's version.

:::tip

The version number must follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) standard.

For example, the version number `1.0.0` is valid, but the version number `1.0` is not valid.

:::

#### groupId

The `groupId` field modifies the project's group ID. This field is used to uniquely identify a
project, or set of projects within a single organization. This field is commonly used in
multiple module projects to group modules together.

:::tip

The group ID must follow
the [Java Package Naming Conventions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html).

For example, the group ID `com.example.project` is valid, but the group ID `com.example-project` is
not valid.

The `artifactId` field modifies the project's artifact ID. This field is used to uniquely identify
a project within a group ID, and is the name of the jar without version. In multiple module

#### project.main.class

The `project.main.class` field modifies the project's main class. This field is used by the Maven
